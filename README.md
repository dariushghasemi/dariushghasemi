- 👋 Hey, I’m Dariush, a Mary-Curie PhD fellow at EURAC Research Institute in Bozen/Bolzano, Italy.
- 👀 I've been constantly looking for the approaches hunting the causal gnetic variants linked to the complex traits like Chronic Kideny Diseases (CKD).
- 🌱  As I'm doing my PhD at Leiden University Medical Center in the Netherlands, , I’m currently learning the biological obstacles for CKD and trying to find a robust statistical approch to properly cope with it, e.g. reducing the false discovery rate of GWAS and increase the power.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on drug targets dicovery projects.
